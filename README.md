## Introduction
<div align="justify">
The modern MedISeg publications usually focus on presentations of the major contributions while unwittingly ignoring some marginal implementation tricks, leading to a potential problem of the unfair experimental result comparisons. In this work, we collect a series of MedISeg tricks for different model implementation phases, and experimentally explore the effectiveness of these tricks on the consistent baselines. Compared to the paper-driven surveys that only blandly focus on the advantage and limitation analyses, our work provides a large number of solid experiments and is more technically operable. Witnessed by the extensive experimental results on both the representative 2D and 3D medical image datasets, we explicitly clarify the effect of these tricks.

## Inference with Pre-trained Models
Download the trained weights from [here](#Model-Zoo). 

Run the following command for 2DUNet:
```
python 2DUNet/NetworkTrainer/test.py --test-model-path $YOUR_MODEL_PATH
```

Run the following command for 3DUNet:
```
python 3DUNet/NetworkTrainer/test.py --test-model-path $YOUR_MODEL_PATH
```

## Training & Evaluation
We provide the shell scripts for training and evaluation by 5-fold cross-validation. 

Run the following command for 2DUNet:
```
sh 2DUNet/config/baseline.sh
```

Run the following command for 3DUNet:
```
sh 3DUNet/config/baseline.sh
```
And the commands train/test with various tricks are also provided in  */config/. For the details of the segmentation tricks, please refer to the paper.

## Model Zoo

- Since our Google space is very limited, here we only provide a part of the weight links. 

- In each 5-fold cross-validation, here we only release a weight with a higher performance.

- The full weights can be downloaded [Baidu Netdisk](https://github.com/hust-linyi/MedISeg)
