The repo contains the official PyTorch Implementation for paper:  
[Bag of Tricks with Convolutional Neural Networks for Medical Image Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/list/cs.CV/recent)

### An illustration of the surveyed MIS tricks and their latent relations  
We separate an medical image segmentation model into six implementation phases, which include pre-training model, data pre-processing, data augmentation, model implementation, model inference, and result post-processing. For each trick, we experimentally explore its effectiveness on the consistent CNNs segmentation baselines including 2D-UNet and 3D-UNet on three medical image segmentation datasets.
